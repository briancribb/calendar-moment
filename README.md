<h2>Calendar Moment</h2>
<p><small><em>A responsive event calendar built using Moment.js and with lists instead of tables.</em></small></p>

<p>I started with some inspiration from <a title="Tutorial: Creating a Responsive Calendar" href="http://www.searchdiscovery.com/blog/tutorial-creating-a-responsive-calendar/">this wonderful design tutorial</a>, and then started working on building the actual calendar from JavaScript. Everything changed for the better when I saw <a title="Paul Irish endorses Moment.js" href="https://plus.google.com/+PaulIrish/posts/htwWUqxHmUY">Paul Irish endorse Moment.js</a>. I am now using <a title="Moment.js" href="http://momentjs.com/">Moment.js</a> for the basis of this whole project.</p>
<p>The end result will start with an empty <code>div</code> and an <code>id</code>, and the script will do the rest. I'm building this for myself at the moment, but eventually I might turn it into a plugin.</p>
<p>There's nothing Top Secret about this thing, so feel free to nose around.  :-)</p>
